# React-Axios-Lab-01  

## Description  
React-Axios-Lab-01 is a testing lab built with **React**, **Axios**, and the **Unsplash API**, designed to explore efficient API integration and state management. This project allows hands-on experimentation with:

- Fetching images dynamically from **Unsplash API**  
- Managing API requests using **Axios**  
- Implementing **a custom search bar** for user queries  
- Displaying responsive images with a clean UI  

It serves as a structured sandbox for understanding **data fetching and UI rendering** in React applications.  

## Technologies Used  
- **React** – Component-based UI development  
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and development environment  
- **Unsplash API** – Image search and retrieval  
- **Axios** – Promise-based HTTP client for API requests  
- **PropTypes** – Runtime validation for React components  
- **CSS** – Ensuring clean and accessible UI
